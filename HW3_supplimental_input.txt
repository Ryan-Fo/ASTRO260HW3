3) My values here do not match at all. I think this has to do with reading in a singular analytical derivative value
for an equation that needs to apply a chain rule. Sine and cosine oscillate with each repeated derivative which should keep 
overall values within a range. My data seems to grow with the increasing time value. I think this may be user error here, 
however there still should be a discrepancy with my calculated values and what the data shows.

4)I'm unsure how to code this, but we could define the chain rule with sine and cosine in the code because every 5
derivatives it returns to the first trigonometric function. I think if we applied some kind of for loop within the
analysis for this it could help keep the values somewhere reasonably close to what the experimental 
data showed.
